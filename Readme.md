<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Executive Summary </h1>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Introduction </h1>

<b style="font-size: 125%;"> Homeless People in Cumberland County </b>

As of 2025, Cumberland County, North Carolina, reported 383 individuals experiencing homelessness in its annual Point-in-Time (PIT) count, a slight increase from the previous yearâ€™s 380 (CityView NC, 2025). However, local officials caution that this number is likely an undercount due to the limitations of capturing homelessness over a single 24-hour period (CityView NC, 2025). Previous years provide insights into the homeless populationâ€™s composition. A 2021 PIT report showed that 72% of those experiencing homelessness were adults over the age of 24, with males comprising 57.3% and females 42.7% (Cumberland County Community Development, 2014). The report also noted a significant presence of individuals with chronic conditions, mental health issues, and victims of domestic violence (Cumberland County Community Development, 2014). Black and African American residents were disproportionately affected, making up over 40% of the homeless population despite representing only 17.8% of the general population (Cumberland County Community Development, 2014). Key contributing factors to homelessness in the county include lack of transportation, job instability, and eviction, all compounded by systemic issues such as the shortage of affordable housing and inadequate mental health and substance abuse services (Cumberland County Community Development, 2014).

<b style="font-size: 125%;"> Problem Definition </b>

The 2014 Plan to End Homelessness emphasizes that inadequate access to supportive housing, transportation, and job security exacerbates peopleâ€™s inability to achieve stable living conditions, often leading to chronic unsheltered homelessness (Cumberland County Community Development, 2014). An effective solution for Cumberland County must integrate health care access, foster stable employment pathways, and elevate community understanding of homelessness, enabling interventions that address root vulnerabilities and promote long term housing stability.
